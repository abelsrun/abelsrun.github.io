                <h2>Our <span class="highlight">Mission</span></h2>
                <p>Tasmania’s youth are facing a crisis. Too many are disconnected from our state’s natural wonders,
                    trapped by screens that steal their time, health, and connection to the world around them. </p>
                <p>The cost is undeniable: rising mental health struggles, weakened physical wellbeing, fractured
                    families and a generation losing touch with the clean air, native wildlife, and iconic landscapes
                    that define Tasmania. We’ve seen it ourselves, young people growing up unaware of the profound value
                    of our landscapes, only realising their importance too late.</p>
                <p>This is more than a trend; it’s an urgent wake-up call. Technology, while valuable, has gone too far,
                    with addictive platforms pulling kids away from healthy habits. Australian youth fail to meet
                    minimal guidelines to live healthy lifestyle, schools lack the resources to take students into
                    nature, and families feel powerless, often battling their own screen habits. We’re failing our
                    youth, but Abels Run is here to change that.<br></p>
                <p>Through re-engagement programs like bushwalks and nature camps, and preventive education for families
                    and schools, we’re fighting back. Partnering with local organisations, we offer experiences that
                    reconnect youth with Tasmania’s wilderness, fostering resilience and wellbeing. Our mission is to
                    break the cycle of screen addiction and ensure young Tasmanians grow up cherishing their island’s
                    unique environment. Join us in this critical fight to restore balance and protect the future and
                    well-being of our
                    youth. Find out more throughout the website.</p>


                <h2>Our <span class="highlight">History</span></h2>
                <p>Abels Run began in late 2021 when our founder, Noah, launched a fundraising campaign for the Cancer
                    Council's "Do It for Cancer" program. His inspiration was rooted in a deep love for Tasmania’s
                    natural beauty, nurtured through his pursuit of summiting the state’s 158 Abel mountains as an avid
                    mountaineer.</p>
                <p>The driving force behind this mission was profoundly personal - an act of love and support for his
                    terminally ill grandmother, Sheila Jackson, who battled multiple health conditions, including
                    cancer. Sheila’s resilience inspired Noah to push the limits of this physically demanding challenge.
                    In her spare time, Sheila was dedicated to knitting blankets for disadvantaged youth. This remains a
                    cornerstone of Abels Run’s ethos. Tragically, Sheila passed away in early 2022, leaving Noah her
                    wedding ring, which he carries daily as a cherished symbol of her strength. To date, Abels Run has
                    raised over $10,000 for the Cancer Council, reflecting our commitment and the community’s generous
                    support. </p>
                <p>Abels Run has evolved into an independent charitable organisation, focused on making a difference
                    when it’s needed most. Explore our website to learn more about our mission and programs - we’d love
                    for you to join us!</p>

                <h2>Meet the <span class="highlight">Team</span></h2>
                <h4>Noah Etherington <span class="highlight">- Founder</span></h4>
                <p>Noah is the driving force behind Abels Run, the visionary who started this journey and leads the
                    delivery of our services. However, he’s quick to emphasise that this is a collaborative effort.
                    Growing up with limited access to natural environments and discovering their value later in life,
                    Noah recognised the urgent need for a platform like Abels Run to reconnect youth with nature.
                    With a bachelor’s degree in computer science, Noah developed a deep interest in how technology
                    impacts society, particularly the wellbeing of younger generations. His experiences and insights
                    fuel his passion for creating opportunities where youth can step away from screens, embrace the
                    outdoors, and rediscover its benefits for mental and physical health.
                </p>

                <h4>Tyler Hall<span class="highlight"> - Supporting Founder</span></h4>
                <p>Tyler has been a vital part of Abels Run from the outset, bringing compassion and creativity to the
                    team. A Hobart-based family man, Tyler specialises in graphic design and is dedicated to using his
                    skills for charitable causes.
                    His creative vision shapes Abels Run’s brand and outreach, ensuring our message resonates with the
                    community. Tyler is also driven by a personal goal to win a Diemen Award, aligning with our
                    commitment to excellence. Together, Noah and Tyler strive to achieve this recognition as a testament
                    to the quality and impact of Abels Run.

                <h2>Screens to Trails Program</h2>
                <h3>“Our research suggests that if children are offered physical activities they enjoy, they will tend
                    to reduce their screen time.” <strong>- Australian Institute of Family Studies</strong></h3>
                <p>How refreshing is a walk in Tasmania? The clean air, the native birds, the shared moments with
                    others, the mental clarity… the absence of phone service. Abels Runs Screens to Trails Program,
                    delivered through schools and community partnerships, offers
                    Tasmanian youth a real-world alternative to screen-driven lifestyles. Our workshops and guided
                    outdoor activities help young people deepen their connection to their identity and Tasmania’s
                    natural environment, free from digital distractions. By streamlining policies, we relieve teachers
                    of navigating outdated procedures while supporting the education sector by aligning with academic
                    outcomes. Using top-quality equipment from renowned Australian brand One Planet, we lead groups of
                    up 15 young people on wilderness hikes, focusing on open discussions addressing distress, mental
                    health challenges,
                    sleep disturbances, and reduced physical activity caused by excessive screen use. These accessible,
                    engaging experiences promote emotional and psychological wellbeing, inspiring youth to embrace the
                    outdoors as a healthy alternative to screen time.</p>

                <h2>ScreenSmart Sessions</h2>
                <h3>“More than one in ten parents said they wouldn’t know where to get help for a screen-related problem
                    for their child if they needed it.” <strong>- The Royal Children’s Hospital Melbourne</strong></h3>
                <p>Our Screen Smart Sessions are preventive solutions that educate families on recognising and managing
                    the harmful effects of excessive screen time. Through expert-led discussions and interactive
                    activities, we empower parents with evidence from Australian Government research, highlighting links
                    between screen use, reduced physical activity, cyberbullying, increased suicide ideation, and mental
                    health challenges. These sessions equip families with practical tools and a fresh perspective on
                    their children’s screen habits, enabling them to foster healthier lifestyles. Participants may also
                    gain insights into their own screen use, strengthening family-wide wellbeing.</p>

                <p>Our claim that everyday devices harm mental and physical well-being is backed by research. The
                    Australian Government provides guidelines for healthier living and tracks the consequences of
                    non-compliance. Below are the statistics driving Abel's Run’s mission, with links for further

                    heart rate; more is better.<br></p>
                <p> <strong>Why this matters.</strong><br>
                    • In 2022, only 5.6% of young people met physical activity guidelines.<br>
                    • Heavy media use is linked to reduced physical activity and unhealthy weight gain.<br>
                    • Over 25% of children lack physical activity due to screen use.<br><br>

                <h2><span class="highlight">Sleep</span></h2>
                <p>Adequate sleep supports appetite regulation, metabolism, mood, and immune, hormonal, and
                    cardiovascular function. Poor sleep impacts quality of life, increases chronic health risks, and
                    affects the economy.</p>
                <p><strong>Guideline</strong>: Youth aged 14–17 should get 8–10 hours of uninterrupted sleep, with no
                    phone access one hour before bed.</p>
                <p> <strong>Why this matters.</strong><br>
                    • A quarter of 12–15-year-olds and half of 16–17-year-olds don’t get enough sleep on school
                    nights.<br>
                    • 43% of children use screen-based devices at bedtime, with 26% experiencing sleep problems.<br>
                    • Adolescents not meeting sleep guidelines are more likely to show anxiety and depression symptoms
                    and less likely to report happiness.<br>
                    • Among 16–17-year-olds with anxiety or depression, nearly 60% fail to meet sleep
                    guidelines.<br>
                    • Much greater proportions of adolescents across all age groups who rated themselves as ‘not
                    happy’ compared to ‘happy’ did not meet the minimum sleep guidelines.<br><br>

                <h2><span class="highlight">Screen Time</span></h2>
                <p>Screen time via TVs, e-games, tablets, and smartphones is a regular part of children’s lives. Parents
                    rank excessive screen time as their top health concern for kids.</p>
                <p><strong>Guideline</strong>: No more than 2 hours of sedentary recreational screen time daily to
                    support healthy development.</p>
                <p> <strong>Why this matters.</strong><br>• Screen time increases with age: under 2 years (14.2 hours/week), 2–5 years (25.9 hours/week),
                    primary school (31.5 hours/week), teenagers (43.6 hours/week).<br>
                    • Most parents use screens to occupy kids for convenience.<br>
                    • Parents with high screen use report higher screen use in their children.<br>
                    • Over half of parents of teenagers and a third of parents of children under 6 set no screen time or
                    content limits.<br>
                    • 62% of parents report family conflict due to screen-based devices.<br>
                    • 94% of teenagers, 67% of primary schoolers, and 36% of preschoolers own mobile screen-based
                    devices.<br>
                    • 19% of teenagers experience online bullying.<br>
                    • Research has found a direct link between Social Media and a rise in depression, anxiety,
                    self-harm, suicide, and body dysmorphia.<br>
                    • Research links excessive screen use with disruptions in motor and cognitive development.<br>
                    • Internal META (Facebook, Instagram) research found their platform "is harmful for a sizeable
                    percentage of teenagers".<br>
                    • Whistleblowers of META acknowledged their platforms ability to expose youth to Nudity, Sexual
                    Advancements, Self-Harm and Suicide.<br><br>

                <h2>Enough is <span class="highlight">Enough</span></h2>
                <p>Technology is a powerful tool, but without moderation, it’s become a dangerous force in the lives of
                    Tasmania’s youth. Numerous reports reveal a stark reality: we’re in the grip of a global crisis
                    driven by screen addiction. This isn’t a fleeting trend— it’s a systemic threat to entire
                    generations. Research shows alarming rises in cyberbullying, depression, anxiety, sleep
                    disturbances, self-harm, and suicidal ideation among young people, directly linked to excessive
                    screen use. These trends contribute to declining academic performance, reduced employment prospects,
                    and a troubling disconnect from the outdoors, robbing youth of the mental clarity and physical
                    vitality Tasmania’s wilderness can provide.</p>

                    <p>This crisis demands action, and Abels Run is answering the call. We’re committed to breaking the
                    cycle of screen addiction by offering young Tasmanians alternatives through immersive outdoor
                    experiences. Our programs, like guided bushwalks, nature workshops, and community camps, reconnect
                    youth with Tasmania’s clean air, native wildlife, and iconic peaks. We also support families and
                    schools with preventive education, providing tools to combat technology’s grip and foster balance in
                    a digital world. Our mission is to safeguard the future of our community by prioritizing the
                    wellbeing of Tasmania’s youth.</p>

                    <p>We cannot ignore this wake-up call. Without urgent change, we risk losing a generation to screens
                    and away from the natural wonders that define our island. Join Abels Run in this critical fight to
                    restore health, resilience, and a deep connection to Tasmania’s extraordinary landscapes.</p>
